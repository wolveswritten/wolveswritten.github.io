#### Preface

About a year and a half ago, I started to do some updates on my photo blog [ivefoughtgiants](http://www.ivefoughtgiants.com) in an attempt to "modernize" it. _Go ahead...click it, I know you want to!_ What started as a simple facelift ended up being a complete rework, which took a few a days of hacking together some tumblr themes I found and relearning CSS. 

When I finished it, I was pretty happy with my work...

And then a few days later, I realized that I hated it. In fact, I hated it so much that I stopped posting. 


#### Justin + Web Development (A Brief History)

I began doing web development/design back in high school and continued through college. Technically, I did web development professionally! It's on my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jshum/), so it's legit! The funny thing is that I hated doing it (common theme here). I loved programming, but making websites always was a chore to me. And, much like my blog, I stopped. (To be fair, I was interested in programming because I wanted to make games, not websites.)

From the time I last did any serious (non-tumblr theme) web development, to now, a lot has changed in how people interact on the web. For starters, the iPhone had not even been released. People were still using Sidekicks. Not many phones had touchscreens, and 3G was still pretty new. There was no notion of Responsive Web Design.

_So what does this have to do with anything?_ 

#### Works Written

I've been lazy for a while now. Actually that's quit the understatement. I haven't done anything outside of work for a while, and I'm a little tired of that. *My goal in doing this is to force myself to be creative in any way possible and to learn new things by posting about them.* Whether it's web development, game design, or even gardening, I'll try to keep it interesting and/or insightful. It'll probably be pretty hodgepodge, but hopefully good...hopefully.

If you have question or thoughts please add comment below!

Thanks!

Justin
